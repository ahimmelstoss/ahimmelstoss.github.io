		<p>Before starting the Flatiron prework I had never been inside my terminal window before. I knew what it was, but I never ventured in, mostly out of fear of breaking something. I knew terminal was serious techie territory; navigating around on the computer without it was just using an interface, and those who knew the terminal were just computer geniuses. I however, wasn&rsquo;t that. I have always been good with computers, comfortable and capable of general problem solving. I mean, I even knew what terminal was; not many I know do.</p>

<p>While doing the prework and going over command line basics, my mind was in many ways blown. A simple <code>-ls</code> while in a directory I knew very well from the GUI side of things suddenly had a whole new display. Navigating through directories, making (and deleting, but very carefully) files from the command line offered me a sense of control over my machine* and an understanding of what it all looked like, really.</p>

<p>One thing I have been grappling with through the prework and in the first days of school is the fear of breaking things. Through the command line, I&rsquo;m in a different world than what I&rsquo;ve always been familiar with. And this world feels more serious. Before, I could move a file through dragging it, and I wouldn&rsquo;t lose it or get confused, because I myself physically put it there. From the command line, things could get confusing  if I&rsquo;m not careful or paying attention. Before I could delete a file of folder and it would go safely into the trash bin. Now, a simple <code>rm -f</code> or <code>rm rf</code> deletes it forever. That&rsquo;s serious.</p>

<p>Even with code, I&rsquo;ve paused before running it not out of anticipation of what it might do, but with what might break, even if it&rsquo;s just testing. I&rsquo;m used to living in a world where I can&rsquo;t really break my computer, because I&rsquo;m just on the surface. The command line changes this. One of the most important things with programming is being comfortable with breaking things, and I&rsquo;m trying every day to have more courage in doing that.</p>

<p>*Once you start referring to your pretty MBP Retina as a machine I think means you&rsquo;ve crossed over to the nerd side of things :)</p>

		<p>When beginning to learn Ruby, I never came across RSpec in the list of buzzwords and acronyms associated with programming. With my first exposure to RSpec and the concept of Test Driven Development, I was a bit confused about what the purpose was. When writing methods, I assumed calling methods gave all of the testing necessary to know that your program works. RSpec, I&rsquo;ve learned, goes beyond that.</p>

<p>Jason Arhart&rsquo;s RSpec for Beginners presentation for the Las Vegas Ruby Group givens a concise yet comprehensive overview of what the purpose of using RSpec tests is. The point that really stuck with me is the idea of &ldquo;focus on the what before the how&rdquo;. One of the things I&rsquo;m making a conscious effort to practice while learning to code is to slow down, think methodically, and break down each necessarly step. Writing RSpec tests is one way to do this. In order to write an effective RSpec test, you must know first what you&rsquo;re program needs to do. This must be done before the how&lt;.</p>

<p>Another thing Jason focuses on in his presentation is how RSpec tests account of expected behavior. We talk about this sometimes in class, and it&rsquo;s one thing I like to think about when programming: it&rsquo;s important to account for all the things a user might do with your program. I like to think about these things while programming because one of the most exciting things about coding for me is the idea of my products being used by others and how they use them; RSpec testing creates a comprehensive way of testing for all of those different user possibilities.</p>
